# Experiment No: 6
## Title: Study & Implementation of
- Group by & Having Clause
- Order by Clause
- Indexing

### Objective:
To learn the concept of group functions

### Theory:

#### GROUP BY:
This query is used to group all the records in a relation together for each value of a specific key(s) and then display them for a selected set of fields in the relation.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT <set of fields> FROM <relation_name>
GROUP BY <field_name>;
```

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT EMPNO, SUM(SALARY) FROM EMP GROUP BY EMPNO;
```

#### GROUP BY-HAVING:
The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword could not be used with aggregate functions. The HAVING clause must follow the GROUP BY clause in a query and must also precede the ORDER BY clause if used.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column_name, aggregate_function(column_name) FROM table_name
WHERE column_name operator value
GROUP BY column_name
HAVING aggregate_function(column_name) operator value;
```

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT Employees.LastName, COUNT(Orders.OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders
FROM (Orders
INNER JOIN Employees
ON Orders.EmployeeID=Employees.EmployeeID) 
GROUP BY LastName
HAVING COUNT(Orders.OrderID) > 10;
```

#### JOIN using GROUP BY:
This query is used to display a set of fields from two relations by matching a common field in them and also group the corresponding records for each value of a specified key(s) while displaying.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT <set of fields (from both relations)> FROM relation_1, relation_2
WHERE relation_1.field_x=relation_2.field_y GROUP BY field_z;
```

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT empno, SUM(SALARY) FROM emp, dept
WHERE emp.deptno = 20 GROUP BY empno;
```

#### ORDER BY:
This query is used to display a selected set of fields from a relation in an ordered manner based on some field.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT <set of fields> FROM <relation_name>
ORDER BY <field_name>;
```

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT empno, ename, job FROM emp ORDER BY job;
```

#### JOIN using ORDER BY:
This query is used to display a set of fields from two relations by matching a common field in them in an ordered manner based on some fields.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT <set of fields (from both relations)> FROM relation_1, relation_2
WHERE relation_1.field_x = relation_2.field_y ORDER BY field_z;
```

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT empno, ename, job, dname FROM emp, dept
WHERE emp.deptno = 20 ORDER BY job;
```

#### INDEXING:
An index is an ordered set of pointers to the data in a table. It is based on the data values in one or more columns of the table. SQL Base stores indexes separately from tables.

An index provides two benefits:
- It improves performance because it makes data access faster.
- It ensures uniqueness. A table with a unique index cannot have two rows with the same values in the column or columns that form the index key.

**Syntax:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX <index_name> on <table_name> (attrib1, attrib2â€¦.attrib n);
```

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX id1 on emp(empno, dept_no);
```

### LAB PRACTICE ASSIGNMENT:
Create a relation and implement the following queries:
1. Display total salary spent for each job category.
2. Display lowest paid employee details under each manager.
3. Display number of employees working in each department and their department name.
4. Display the details of employees sorting the salary in increasing order.
5. Show the record of employee earning salary greater than 16000 in each department.
6. Write queries to implement and practice the above clause.
